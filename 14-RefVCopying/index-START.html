    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100

    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // kir kir
    name = 'kirsty';
    console.log(name, name2); // kirsty kir

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Pretzel';
    console.log(players, team); // OH NO - changes both arrays
    // if you update an array it will always reference back
    // ie it updates the array AND the array it referenced

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // console.log(players, team2); // they're the same
    team2[0] = 'Jaylen';
    console.log('Copied with Slice method', players, team2); // they're different!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // console.log(players, team3); // Same upon creation
    team3[0] = 'Jaylen';
    console.log('Copied with concat method', players, team3); // now they're different!

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // console.log(players, team4); // Same upon creation
    team4[0] = 'Jaylen';
    console.log('Copied with spread method', players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person, captain); // oops we've edited both objects!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // start with new empty object, copy properties from person, edit the bits you want
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 53 });
    console.log('Copied with object.assign', person, captain2);
    

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 203,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    // console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes, { name: 'wesley'}) // edits only new object as edited property is only one level deep
    // console.log(dev);
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'; // edits both objects
    // console.log(wes, dev);

    //'the poor mans deepClone'
    //this is a way to edit deep properties
    //turns object to string then immediately back into an object
    //which shakes off the reference
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.twitter = '@lamedude';
    // console.log(wes, dev, dev2);
